## Introduction

INDEX uses vector embeddings from variable descriptions to suggest mappings for datasets based on their semantic similarity. Mappings are stored with their vector representations in a knowledge base, where they can be used for subsequent harmonisation tasks, potentially improving suggestions with each iteration. The tool is designed to be configurable and extendable, adapting for specific use-cases through customizable models and databases.

## Installation

### Local Development Server

#### Starting the backend

```bash
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn routes:app --reload --port 5000
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to access the backend.

#### Starting the frontend

```bash
cd client
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn routes:app --reload --port 5000
```

Navigate to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to access the frontend.

### Docker

You can start both frontend and API using docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yaml up
```
